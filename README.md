# CTU Adventure Game Engine

Welcome to CTU Adventure, a game engine based on Java that allows you to create customizable levels with the main objective of reaching the boss in time and defeating him.

## Overview

The main objective of the game is to reach the boss in time and defeat him. The levels are customizable, enabling you to change the starting positions of both the player and the enemies, set the timer, and upload the inventory. By default, you start with a standard amount of time which will begin to decrease as soon as you start the game. Your purpose is to defeat the boss before running out of time.

However, the graphics have been replaced, and additional small features have been implemented to enhance the gameplay experience.
